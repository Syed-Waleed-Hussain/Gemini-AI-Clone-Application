## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Install Dependencies  
**For Python-based backend:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**If you're using Node.js:**
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Add Your Gemini API Key  
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or replace it directly in your code where applicable.

## ▶️ Usage

├── .env                      # API Key (ignored by Git)
├── requirements.txt / package.json
└── README.md
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a prompt into the frontend chat box.  
2. The backend sends the prompt to the Gemini API using your API key.  
3. The response is processed and returned in a conversational format.  
4. The UI updates with the response, simulating a chatbot experience.

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure your Gemini API quota is active and not exceeded.  
- Keep your `.env` file secure and **never commit it to GitHub**.
